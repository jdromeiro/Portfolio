# Portfolio
A collection and description of some of my work.

## XD-ConServ
A program that enables the verification of reinforced concrete frame members to the serviceability limit states in Eurocode 2, through the assessment of the installed stresses, the crack width and the deflections.



## GeM
A program that performs stability verification of web-tapered steel members by the use of the General Method present in part 1-1 of Eurocode 3.



## Diamond 2016
A post-processor for the finite element code SAFIRÂ®. This new version is based on the previous versions of Diamond. My work involved the addition of ![new features](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdromeiro/Portfolio/master/New_features_DIAMOND.pdf) to the software.
